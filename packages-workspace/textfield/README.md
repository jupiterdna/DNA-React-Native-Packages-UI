# DNA React Native TextField

An essential element for entering text into the application through a keyboard, this foundational component offers configurability through props for various features. These include options for auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and the ability to choose different keyboard types, such as a numeric keypad.

The primary use case involves placing a TextInput and subscribing to the onChangeText events to capture user input. Additionally, other events like onSubmitEditing and onFocus are available for subscription.
