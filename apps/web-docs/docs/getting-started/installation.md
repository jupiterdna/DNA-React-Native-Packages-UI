# Installation

Each component is constructed independently, requiring the installation of the specific control you intend to use.

**For Example:**

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rndna/theme-provider @rndna/button
```
Additionally, for the iOS platform, it is necessary to link the native components of the library.

```bash 
cd ios 
pod install
```
